To Find Nth character in decrypted string:

Every character in the input string is followed by it's frequency.
Write a function to decrypt the string and find the "n0" character of the decrypted string.
If no character exists at the position then return "-1".
For example,if the input string is "a2b3" then the decrypted string is "aaabb"
Input :
input 1 : A string
input 2 : n,the position of the character starting from 1
Output :
Nth position character else -1

Example 1:
i/p 1=a1b1c3
i/p 2=5
o/p=c 

Example 2:
i/p 1=a3b2
i/p 2=7
o/p=-1
